# UNL Software Engineering Discord Bot

## Usage
This is used for sending wonderful and timely reminders on when a software engineering assignment is due at UNL. The script is not limited to our software engineering course since the arguments are free to be changed to whatever suits you. In other words, it could also be used for notifying when assignments are due in other classes on Canvas. This is done by sending out a Discord message to our server.

## Structure
This project was originally written in Java, which is now deprecated, but is now maintained in Ruby. You can find the Java project in the "Java" folder and the Ruby project in the "Ruby" folder. Each has their own README with more information.
